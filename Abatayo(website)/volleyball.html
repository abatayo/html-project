    <h2>What is volleyball?</h2>
    -Volleyball, game played by two teams, usually of six players on a side, in which the players use their hands<br>
     to bat a ball back and forth over a high net, trying to make the ball touch the court within the opponentsâ€™<br>
      playing area before it can be returned.<br>
    -To prevent this a player on the opposing team bats the ball up and toward a teammate before it touches the court<br>
    surface that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net.<br>
    A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.
    <h2>What is the main purpose of Volleyball?</h2>
    - The objective of volleyball is to make the ball go over the net and land in the court of the opponent so it cannot be returned.<br>
     It is a team sport that relies on cooperation and coordination of the team to win. Volleyball can be adapted to any skill level<br>
    and location of play, but the basics rules stay the same.
    <h3>Their are two types of Volleyball:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>In door volleyball</h4></li>
        - The game, originally called Mintonette when it was invented in Holyoke, Massachusetts, in 1895, has developed into what <br>
        we now know as indoor volleyball. The sport has evolved further to be played in various disciplines and formats across different<br>
        surfaces based on the same set of core rules.
        <li><h4>Beach volleyball</h4></li>
        - Beach volleyball is a team sport played by two teams of two players each on a sand court divided by a net. Similar to indoor<br>
         volleyball, the objective of the game is to send the ball over the net and to ground it on the opponent's side of the court.
