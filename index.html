            Unforgettable memories:<br>
            When i was in Elementary i got a memory that i can't forget, it happens two times in Kindergarten and in Grade 1. I poop into my<br>
            underwear. Luckily since our house is near the campus thanks to my grandmother i got rescued immediately. In  high i also have a lot<br>
            of memories with my bestfriend. First, we got suspended for 1 week cause we're doing a truth or dare challenge. Which is, if one of us<br>
            declined the challenge she or he must bought a food for everyone. One of our friend chooses a dare and the dare was to dance in the<br>
            roof of our stage. But the unllucky hits us our teacher caught us in action. Second,  We got our selves into the guidance office cause<br>
            me and my friends jump into the gate to buy some foods. But unfortunately our school forbidden us to go outside the campus. One of our<br>
            subject teacher caught us so she immediately call us to the office. Lastly, i got into a fight which everyone in campus was watching. The<br>
            reason why i got into a fight just beacuse my classmate was jelous of me being the best dancer in our school. He gossip a wrong information<br>
            about me which led me to angriness. I scrambled his faces until i scratch his ears and the wond was a little bit big. So again we got to the<br>
            principals office with our parents and settle things.
